# Hi! I'm Guilherme Salvi! 👋🏻

As a Senior Software Engineer at XP Inc, I am passionate about developing systems that make a positive impact on people's lives and businesses. I work with C#, Azure, and Apache Kafka to create scalable, reliable, and secure solutions for the credit market in Brazil.

I am also pursuing a graduate degree in Leadership and Management in Technology at Escola Conquer, where I am learning how to lead and manage teams, projects, and innovations in the tech industry. I have a bachelor's degree in Systems Analysis and Development from FIAP, where I gained a solid foundation in software engineering principles and practices. I have multiple certifications in Azure, Kafka, and leadership, and I am always eager to learn new skills and technologies.
